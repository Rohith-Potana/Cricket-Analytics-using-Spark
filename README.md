# Cricket-Analytics-using-Spark
This project uses Apache Spark on Google Colab to analyze IPL cricket data. It involves data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. Advanced analytics, including player clustering and predictive modeling, uncover insights into player performance and match outcomes, aiding decision-making for teams and analysts.

Types of data preprocessing done:

1. Schema Definition and Data Loading:
Explicitly define the schema for complex datasets to ensure correct data types.
Use inferred schema for simpler datasets by directly loading the CSV files.

2. Initial Data Inspection:
Display the first few rows of each dataset to understand the initial structure and contents.

3. Handling Missing Values:
Drop rows with any null values to maintain data integrity and avoid issues during analysis.

4. Data Type Conversion:
Convert specific columns to the appropriate data types to ensure correct data processing and analysis.

5. Creating Temporary Views:
Create temporary views for DataFrames to enable SQL queries, facilitating more flexible and powerful data manipulation.
